# LUNA Project - Lunar-Inspired Optimization Algorithm

🌙 LUNA Algorithm

LUNA (Lutfan’s Unique Neural-based Algorithm) is an optimization and computation framework designed to explore complex problem-solving through intelligent heuristics, inspired by symbiotic and adaptive systems. This repository provides documentation, workflow, and demonstration results of the algorithm.

🚀 Features
- 🧠 **Intelligent Optimization** – Implements advanced heuristics for adaptive problem-solving.  
- ⚡ **Fast & Scalable** – Designed to handle both small and large-scale datasets.  
- 🔍 **Transparent & Open** – Easy-to-read workflow with clear step-by-step documentation.  
- 📊 **Demo Results** – Includes experimental results and test cases for validation.
